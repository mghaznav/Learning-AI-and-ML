# My AI and ML Learning Journey

## Introduction

Welcome to my AI and ML learning repository! This space is dedicated to my journey of exploring the exciting field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) through practical problem-solving. I will be using problems from various sources, with a special focus on challenges from OpenAI's Gymnasium. The primary goal is to learn and grow my skills in AI and ML while sharing my solutions with the world for feedback and improvement.

## Repository Structure

At the base level of this repository, you will find multiple folders, each representing my attempt at solving a problem from OpenAI's Gymnasium and other sources. Each problem folder contains my solution along with a dedicated `readme.md` file providing instructions on how to get the code up and running.

## Python Version

All the code in this repository was written using Python 3.11.4. If you want to run the code locally, make sure you have Python 3.11.4 (or compatible versions) installed on your system.

## Installation

To install all the required Python libraries and dependencies for running the code in this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone` or download it as a ZIP archive and extract it.

2. Navigate to the root of the repository using the command line or terminal.

3. Run the following command to install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

This command will read the requirements.txt file and automatically install all the necessary Python libraries with their compatible versions.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring my solutions, follow these steps:

1. Choose a specific problem folder from the base level that interests you.

2. Read the corresponding `readme.md` file inside the problem folder for instructions on how to set up and run the code.

3. Dive into the code and explore my solutions to understand the AI and ML techniques used.

## Feedback and Contributions

I welcome feedback and suggestions from the AI and ML community to help me improve and learn. If you have any ideas, optimizations, or alternative approaches for the problems I've tackled, please don't hesitate to share them. Together, we can enhance our understanding and capabilities in AI and ML.

Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or reach out to me with any thoughts or questions you may have.

## Note

This repository represents my learning journey, and the solutions provided are just one of the many possible approaches to solving the problems. AI and ML are vast fields with endless possibilities, so let's keep exploring, experimenting, and growing together.

Happy learning, and let's embark on this exciting AI and ML adventure!
